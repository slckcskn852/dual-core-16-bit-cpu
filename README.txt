COMP206 DUAL CORE CPU PROJECT

The report file contains the .pdf file for the report for this project.

The circuit files files contains three circuit files to show we implemented the STR instruction but failed to do it on the final draft.

The one with the dual core functionality is the one called "CPU - with dual core  - mem error".

The one with the memory write functionality (STR implementation) is the one called "CPU - single core error - no mem error".

SC CPU is the first draft of the CPU, included just in case the dual core doesn't function as intended and single core is needed.

SC CPU cannot take instructions from outside txt files since it doesn't have a ROM.

The assembler file contains the C code "main" and 3 text files.

ASM.txt is the input file for the code. ASCII0.txt and ASCII1.txt are the output files from the code.

MATRIX includes the 5.2 test
